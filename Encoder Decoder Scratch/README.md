# Text Summarization using Encoder-Decoder Architecture

## Overview
This project implements text summarization techniques using Natural Language Processing (NLP) on the "Amazon Fine Food Reviews" dataset. The goal is to generate concise summaries from lengthy customer reviews using both abstractive and extractive summarization methods.

## Problem Statement
Customer reviews can be lengthy and detailed, making manual analysis time-consuming. This project aims to automatically generate summaries for the Amazon Fine Food reviews to facilitate quicker understanding and analysis.

## Project Pipeline
1. Understanding Text Summarization
2. Text Pre-processing
3. Abstractive Text Summarization using LSTM, Encoder-Decoder architecture
4. Extractive Text Summarization using Transformer
