# Sentiment Analysis with LSTM, RNN, and GRU

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using three different types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs): SimpleRNN, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). The models are trained to predict the next word in a sequence based on input text data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is twitter sentiment analysis taken from Kaggle.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
